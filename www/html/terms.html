        <p>You are responsible for your conduct while using our service. You must comply with the following requirements when using the service:
            <br>You may not misuse our service by interfering with its normal operation, or attempting to access it using a method other than through the interface that we provide.
            <br>You may not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any voidtech system or network. All connections are monitored.
            <br>You may not use any manual or automated system or software to extract or scrape data from the interfaces provided.

        </p>
        <h3 class="centre-align header header-sub">What data do we collect?</h3>
        <p>We collect and store your username and nickname and messages you send. We do not store or process IP addresses or cookies. We do not store or process any personal data.</p>
        <h3 class="centre-align header header-sub">How long do we keep it for?</h3>
        <p>We store usernames and nicknames until a user deletes their account. We store message history of a room until the room is disbanded (when everyone has left).</p>
        <h3 class="centre-align header header-sub">What do we do with data?</h3>
        <p>Usernames are used to identify user accounts. We generate an authentication token which is associated with a user account once the user has logged in. Authentication tokens are reset when a user changes their password.</p>
        <h3 class="centre-align header header-sub">How do we store data?</h3>
        <p>All user data is stored in our database. Passwords are hashed instead of being stored in plain text. Data is only accessible via the YTParty API.</p>
