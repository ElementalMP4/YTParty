        <p>When using this service, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the following terms:</p>
        <h3 class="centre-align header header-sub">What we expect from you</h3>
        <p>You are responsible for your conduct while using our service. You must comply with the following requirements when using the service or face account termination and service access restriction:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                You may not misuse our service by interfering with its normal operation, or attempting to access it using a method other than through the client that we provide.
            </li>
            <li>
                You may not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any voidtech system or network. All connections are monitored and any violations may result in account termination and service access restriction.
            </li>
            <li>
                You may not use any manual or automated system or software to extract or scrape data from the interfaces provided.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="centre-align header header-sub">What data do we collect?</h3>
        <p>We collect and store your username and nickname and messages you send. We do not store or or process cookies. We use IP addresses to identify sessions for rate limiting. After 15 minutes of inactivity a recorded IP address is removed from our
            records. We do not persist IP addresses to our database. We do not store or process any personal data including names, dates of birth, location data or any other personal information.</p>
        <p>We understand that privacy is important. As a result, adding a recovery email address to your account is entirely optional. If you choose not to add an email address to your account however, you may not be able to recover your account in the event
            of a password loss.</p>
        <h3 class="centre-align header header-sub">How long do we keep it for?</h3>
        <p>We store usernames and nicknames until a user deletes their account. We store message history of a room until the room is disbanded (when all members have left).</p>
        <h3 class="centre-align header header-sub">What do we do with data?</h3>
        <p>Usernames are used to identify user accounts. We generate an authentication token which is associated with a user account once the user has logged in. Authentication tokens are reset when a user changes their password. We do not transmit any user
            information outside of the YTParty API. All data that we process remains private and unseen by humans. Sensitive data such as passwords are stored as a hash and not plaintext.</p>
        <h3 class="centre-align header header-sub">How do we store data?</h3>
        <p>All user data is stored in our database. Passwords are hashed instead of being stored in plain text. Data is only accessible via the YTParty API using an authorisation token. Tokens for one user cannot be used for another. Some data that users
            input cannot be retrieved via the API for security purposes, however this data can be erased or modified by deleting an account or modifying the account settings. Your data is secured by multiple encrypted levels.</p>
